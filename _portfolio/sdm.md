In this paper we look at how people make dynamic (sequential) decisions. We examine decision-making in a range of dynamic problems and find, unsurprisingly, that most people are not 'forward-looking optimizers'.  Rather, decision rules depend on the type of environment: decision rules are quite simple in stopping (secretary) problems and quite sophisticated in other dynamic problems."

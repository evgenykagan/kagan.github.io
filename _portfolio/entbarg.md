excerpt: "<img src='/images/entbarg.jpeg'  style='float:right;width:400px;' >
In this research we study how entrepreneurs and investors divide equity. We use the Nash bargaining framework and test several predictions in the lab.  We find that
the number of investors matters less than the contract form.  Preferred Stock contracts, which are popular in practice, disadvantage the entrepreneur and lead to more aggressive
investor bargaining tactics."

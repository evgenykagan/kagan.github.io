title: "Ideation-Execution in Product Development: An Experimental Analysis"
collection: publications
excerpt: "This paper is about allocating development time between (creative) idea generation activities, and more production related execution activities.  We find that developers benefit from firm deadlines early on in the creative process.  Granting developers more autonomy leads to delays in idea inception and development."

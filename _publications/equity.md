excerpt: This paper studies incentive design in startups, specifically how to split equity in a startup.  We find that founders who choose to split <i>equally</i> invest little effort into the venture after the split.  Thus, a preference for a contract type can be seen as a signal of desirability as a collaborator.  Delaying the split until some work is done helps remove some of the collaboration difficulties.
